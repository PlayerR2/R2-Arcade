Thank you for choosing R²💗Arcade to show off your games.

This guide will help you to upload your games for the world to see and play.

First be sure that your "build" directory of your game has all the files we
 need, for convenience sake and smaller uploads, we recomend to compress 
 your directory in [ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/) format.

It must include:
```bash
game       <-- or name of game
│
├── build
│   ├── *game.data.unityweb    <-- change '*game' to YOUR game name
│   ├── *game.json
│   ├── *game.wasm.code.unityweb
│   ├── *game.wasm.framework.unityweb
│   └── UnityLoader.js
│   
├── TemplateData   
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── fullscreen.png
│   ├── progress***.png  <-- about 6 '*.png' files
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── UnityProgress.js
│   └── webgl-logo.png
│
└── index.html
```
Use the upload button found on your developers landing page and select your 
compressed `ZIP` file.
After we've received your game, our staff of handpicked fully qualified game 
gnomes will approve your game for all to see and play.

*Criteria for game approval is as follows:
 - No adult games (no nudity/sexual explicity/torture)
 - Must not contain any viruses (viraii?) or hacks
 - No hate or discriminatory content
 Keep in mind, this is a place to share your game to the world!

Please also upload a screen shot to use for the frontpage (if not we'll take our
own screenshot that may or may not be flattering 😁)

Be sure to keep your Contact info up to date in case any potential clients/fans
wish to contact you (unless you would NOT like your info published feel free to
check that option on your developers landing page)

Finally tell all your gamer/developer/co-workes/bosses to check R²💗Arcade to
see your game in action!

If you have any concerns/comments or improvements, please feel free to use
the contact us page. Do remember we are humans who just enjoy playing games. 🎮😹
